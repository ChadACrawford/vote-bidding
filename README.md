# Vote-Bidding

A framework for agents "negotiating" with votes. Voters are given a
set of candidates and a utility function for electing each
candidate. They then give preferences for each candidate, which can be
an ordering or just the first agent. The goal of the agent is to
collaborate among others so that it can achieve a beneficial outcome.
